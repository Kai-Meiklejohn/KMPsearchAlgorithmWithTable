Wardell Stephen Curry II (/ˈstɛfən/ STEF-ən;[1] born March 14, 1988) is an American professional 
basketball player and point guard for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association 
(NBA). Nicknamed "Chef Curry",[2] he is widely considered the greatest[under discussion] shooter of 
all time[3][4] and is credited with revolutionizing the sport by inspiring teams and players at all 
levels to more prominently utilize the three-point shot.[9] He is a four-time NBA champion, a two-time 
NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), an NBA Finals MVP, and a two-time NBA All-Star Game MVP. He is also a two
-time NBA scoring champion, an eleven-time NBA All-Star, and a ten-time All-NBA 
Team selection (including four on the First Team). Internationally, he has won two gold medals at the 
FIBA World Cup and a gold medal at the 2024 Summer Olympics as part of the U.S. 
national team.

Curry played collegiately for the Davidson Wildcats, where he was named Conference Player of the Year
 twice, and set the NCAA single-season record for three-pointers made 
 (162) during his sophomore year. Curry was selected by the Warriors as the seventh overall pick in the 
 2009 NBA draft.

In 2014–15, Curry won his first league MVP award and led the Warriors to their first championship since 
1975. The following season, he became the first player to be elected MVP by a unanimous vote and lead 
the league in scoring while shooting above 50–40–90. That same year, the Warriors broke the record for 
the most wins in a regular season in NBA history (73) en route to the 2016 NBA Finals, which they lost to 
the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 7. Curry helped the Warriors win back-to-back titles in 2017 and 2018, 
and reach the 2019 NBA Finals, losing to the Toronto Raptors in six games. Following injury 
struggles and missed playoff appearances in 2020 and 2021, Curry won his fourth championship with the 
Warriors and first Finals MVP award, defeating the Boston Celtics in the 2022 NBA Finals. 
The same season, he became the all-time leader in three-pointers made in NBA history, surpassing 
Ray Allen.[10]

Curry has the highest career free-throw percentage in NBA history (91.0%) and has led the league in
 three-pointers made a record eight times. In 2013, he set the NBA record for three-pointers made in a 
 regular season with 272, surpassed that record in 2015 (286), and again in 2016 (402).

Early life
Curry was born on March 14, 1988,[11] at the Akron General Medical Center in Akron, Ohio, to Sonya 
(née Adams) and Dell Curry.[12][13] He grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina, where his father spent 
most of his NBA career with the Charlotte Hornets.[13][14] He played with his younger brother Seth on 
their backyard basketball court in Charlotte.[15] The family briefly moved to Toronto, where Dell 
finished out his career as a member of the Raptors.[14] During this time, Curry played for the Queensway 
Christian College boys' basketball team, leading them to an undefeated season.[16][17] He was also a 
member of Toronto 5–0, a club team that plays across Ontario,[18][19] pitting him against fellow future 
NBA players Cory Joseph and Kelly Olynyk.[19] Curry led the team to a 33–4 record, en route to winning 
the provincial championship.[20]

After Dell's retirement, the family moved back to Charlotte and Curry enrolled at Charlotte Christian 
School,[citation needed] where he was named all-conference and all-state, and led his team to three 
conference titles and three state playoff appearances. Because of his father's storied career at Virginia 
Tech, Curry wanted to play college basketball for the Hokies, but was only offered a walk-on spot due in
 part to his slender 160-pound frame.[21] He ultimately chose to attend Davidson College, who had 
 aggressively recruited him from the tenth grade.[22]

College career
Freshman season
Before Curry even played in his first game for the Wildcats, head coach Bob McKillop praised 
him at a Davidson alumni event, saying: "Wait 'til you see Steph Curry. He is something special."
[23] In his second collegiate game, he recorded a season-high 32 points and nine rebounds against 
Michigan.[24] He had 30 points and a season-high 11 rebounds against Chattanooga on December 18, 2006, 
for his first career double-double.[24] On February 6, 2007, also against Chattanooga, Curry broke the 
school's 500-point freshman record.


Sophomore season

Curry at the 2008 NCAA tournament
In his sophomore season in 2007–08, 
Curry helped the Wildcats to a 26–6 regular-season record, a 
20–0 conference record, and a trip to the 2008 NCAA tournament.[28]

On March 21, 2008, Davidson matched up with seventh-seeded Gonzaga. Gonzaga led by 
11 points early in the second half but Curry went on to score 30 points in the half
[29] to push Davidson to their first NCAA tournament win since 1969 with a score of 
82–76. Curry ended the game with 40 points while also going 8-of-10 from three-point range.[30] 
On March 23, Davidson played second-seeded Georgetown in the second round, with Curry scoring 
just five points in the first half of the game as Davidson trailed by as many as 17 points. 
His 25 second-half points led Davidson to a 74–70 comeback victory.[29] On March 28, Curry led 
Davidson to another win, against third-seeded Wisconsin. He scored 33 points as Davidson won 73–56 
to advance to the Elite 8.[31] Curry joined Clyde Lovellette, Jerry Chambers, and Glenn Robinson as 
the only college players to score over 30 points in their first four career NCAA tournament games.
[31] Curry also tied Darrin Fitzgerald of Butler for the single-season record for most three-pointers 
with 158.[32][33] On March 30, he set the record, against the top-seeded Kansas Jayhawks, with his 
159th three-pointer of the season. Curry scored 25 points in the game but Davidson lost 59–57, and the 
Jayhawks went on to win the championship.[34]

Curry finished the season averaging 25.9 points, 2.9 assists, and 2.1 steals per game. 
He was named to the Associated Press' All-America Second Team on March 31, 2008.[35] He also was 
named the Most Outstanding Player of the Midwest Region of the NCAA tournament, becoming the first
 player from a team not making the Final Four to do so since Juwan Howard of Michigan in 1994.[36] 
 Curry was nominated for an ESPY in the Breakthrough Player of the Year category.[37]

Junior season
Following Davidson's loss in the NCAA Regional Finals, Curry announced that he would return for 
his junior year.[32] On November 18, 2008, he scored a career-high 44 points in Davidson's 82–78 
loss to Oklahoma.[38] He extended a career-long streak by scoring at least 25 points for the seventh 
straight game.[38] On November 21, Curry registered a career-high 13 assists, to go along with 30 points 
in Davidson's 97–70 win over Winthrop.[39] On November 25, against Loyola, Curry was held scoreless as 
Loyola constantly double-teamed him. It was Curry's only scoreless collegiate game and just his second 
without double-digit points. He finished 0-of-3 from the field as Davidson won the game 78–48.[40] 
In Davidson's next game 11 days later, Curry matched his career high of 44 in a 72–67 win over North 
Carolina State.[41]

Curry surpassed the 2000-point mark for his career on January 3, 2009, as he scored 21 points against 
Samford.[42] On February 14, 2009, Curry rolled his ankle in the second half of a win over Furman. 
The injury caused Curry to miss the February 18 game against The Citadel, the first and only game he 
missed in his college career.[43] On February 28, 2009, Curry became Davidson's all-time leading 
scorer with 34 points in a 99–56 win against Georgia Southern. That gave Curry 2,488 points for his 
career, surpassing previous school leader John Gerdy.[44] Davidson won the 2008–09 Southern 
Conference regular season championship for the south division, finishing 18–2 in the conference.

Golden State Warriors (2009–present)
Early years (2009–2012)

Curry defending against Allen Iverson in 2009
On June 25, 2009, his father's 45th birthday, Curry was selected as the seventh overall pick in the 
2009 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors.[57] Although the Warriors already had another lean, 
6-foot-3, offensive-minded guard in Monta Ellis, coach Don Nelson had a penchant for using small 
lineups in his Nellie Ball system, and had warmed to the idea of selecting Curry.[58][59] However, 
Ellis announced at a media session that he and Curry were too small to play together.[60] Curry 
appeared in 80 games (77 starts) during the 2009–10 season, averaging 17.5 points, 4.5 rebounds, 
5.9 assists, and 1.90 steals in 36.2 minutes.[61] His second half of the season vaulted him into 
the rookie of the year race.[62] He was named Western Conference Rookie of the Month for January, 
March, and April, finishing as the only Western Conference rookie to win the award three times.[61] 
He finished runner-up for the NBA Rookie of the Year behind Tyreke Evans[62] and was a unanimous NBA 
All-Rookie First Team selection, becoming the first Warriors player since Jason Richardson in 2001–02 
to earn All-Rookie First Team honors.[61] He scored 30-plus points eight times, setting the most 
30-point games by any rookie in 2009–10 and the most since LeBron James had 13 and Carmelo Anthony 
had 10 in 2003–04. Curry had five 30-point/10-assist games, which tied Michael Jordan for the 
second-most 30-point/10-assist games by a rookie (Oscar Robertson is first with 25). He became just the 
sixth rookie in NBA history to post a 35-point, 10-assist, 10-rebound game when he registered his first 
career triple-double with 36 points, 13 assists, and 10 rebounds against the Los Angeles Clippers on 
February 10. In the Warriors' season finale against the Portland Trail Blazers on April 14, Curry 
recorded a then- career-high 42 points, nine rebounds and eight assists, becoming the first rookie 
since Robertson in February 1961 to register at least those numbers in each category in the same game. 
Curry finished his rookie season with 166 three-pointers, which were, at the time, the most ever by 
a rookie in NBA history.[61]


Curry in March 2011
In 2010–11, Curry appeared in 74 games (all starts), averaging 18.6 points, 3.9 rebounds, 
5.8 assists, and 1.47 steals in 33.6 minutes per contest.[61] His free throw percentage of 
.934 (212–227 FT) set a new Warriors single-season record, surpassing the previous mark of 
.924 set by Rick Barry in 1977–78. He also became the first Warriors player to lead the NBA in 
free throw percentage since Mark Price in 1996–97.[61] Curry registered 20-or-more points 35 times
, including seven 30-plus performances. He posted a season-high 39 points and a then- career-high 
14 made field goals (on 20 attempts) against the Oklahoma City Thunder on December 5. In February 2011, 
during All-Star Weekend, Curry won the Skills Challenge[63] and registered 13 points, eight assists, 
and six rebounds in 28 minutes as a member of the Sophomore squad in the Rookie Challenge.
[61] In May 2011, he was named the recipient of the NBA Sportsmanship Award,[64] and underwent 
surgery on his right ankle.[65]

In the lockout-shortened 2011–12 season, Curry appeared in 26 games (23 starts), averaging 
14.7 points, 3.4 rebounds, 5.3 assists, and 1.50 steals in 28.2 minutes per contest. He missed 
40 games due to right ankle and foot injuries,[61] including the last 28 games with a sprained 
right ankle and subsequent surgery on the ankle, which was performed on April 25.[66] In 2012, 
Golden State included Curry in a trade offer to the Milwaukee Bucks for Andrew Bogut, which the 
Bucks rejected due to Curry's history with bad ankles. Ellis was traded instead.[67][68][69] 
According to then- Warriors general manager Larry Riley, they offered Curry with the intention 
of steering the deal to Ellis.[68] The deal opened an opportunity for Curry to lead the team.[60]

First All-Star and playoff appearances (2012–2014)
Prior to the start of the 2012–13 season, Curry signed a four-year, $44 million contract extension 
with the Warriors.[70][71] At the time, many basketball writers considered the move risky for 
Golden State because of Curry's injury history.[72] Over the course of the year, Curry and 
backcourt teammate Klay Thompson gained a reputation for their perimeter scoring, earning them 
the nickname the "Splash Brothers".[73] In 2012–13, Curry appeared in 78 games (all starts), 
averaging then- career highs of 22.9 points (seventh in NBA) and 6.9 assists to go with 
4.0 rebounds and 1.62 steals in 38.2 minutes.[61] He set a new NBA single-season three-point record with 
272 three-pointers, eclipsing the previous mark set by Ray Allen (269 in 2005–06), doing so on 
53 less attempts than Allen did with Seattle.[61]

Curry earned Western Conference Player of the Month honors for the month of April. 
During this time he averaged 25.4 points, 8.1 assists, 3.9 rebounds, and 2.13 steals in 
eight games in the final month of the season to become the third Warrior to win the award, 
joining Chris Mullin (November 1990 and January 1989) and Bernard King (January 1981). 
He tallied two of the NBA's top six scoring games with 54 points on February 27 at 
New York and 47 on April 12 at Los Angeles, becoming the first Warrior to score 
45-plus at New York and Los Angeles in the same season since Rick Barry in 1966, 
joining Barry, Guy Rodgers, and Wilt Chamberlain as the only four Warriors to do so. 
Curry's 54 points against the Knicks included a then- career-best and then- franchise-record 
11 three-pointers, becoming the first player in NBA history to score 50-plus points while hitting 
10-plus three-pointers in a game. It was the most scored by a Warrior since Purvis Short 
tallied 59 points in 1984. In 2013, he appeared in the playoffs for the first time in his 
career, with the Warriors earning the sixth seed in the Western Conference. In 12 
playoff games (all starts), he averaged 23.4 points, 8.1 assists, and 3.8 rebounds. He set a new 
franchise record with 42 playoff three-pointers, eclipsing the Warriors' career playoff 
mark of 29 previously held by Jason Richardson, giving him a total of 314 three-pointers for 
the season to become the first player in NBA history to make at least 300 three-pointers in a 
single season.[61]


Curry in April 2014
In 2013–14, Curry appeared in 78 games (all starts), averaging career highs of 24.0 points 
(seventh in the NBA) and 8.5 assists (fifth in the NBA) to go with 4.3 rebounds and 1.63 steals
, becoming the first player in Warriors franchise history to average 24 points and eight assists 
in a single season (ninth player in NBA history). He led the league in three-pointers made for a 
second consecutive season with 261, becoming the first player since Ray Allen in 2001–02 and 
2002–03 to lead the league in three-pointers in back-to-back seasons. He was named Western 
Conference Player of the Month for April and earned All-NBA Second Team honors, becoming the first 
Warriors player named to the First or Second Team since 1993–94.[61] On December 7 against the 
Memphis Grizzlies, Curry eclipsed Jason Richardson (700) as the franchise's leader in career 
three-pointers.[74] In February, he made his first All-Star appearance,[75] becoming the 
Warriors' first All-Star starter since Latrell Sprewell in 1995.[61] He scored a season-high 
47 points on April 13 against the Portland Trail Blazers for his third 40-point game of the year. 
He finished the regular season tied for second in the NBA in triple-doubles with four, the most 
by a Warrior in a single season since Chamberlain had five in 1963–64.[61] Seeded sixth for the 
second consecutive postseason, the Warriors were defeated in seven games by the Los Angeles 
Clippers.[76]
